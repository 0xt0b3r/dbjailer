# dbjailer
# Modified script. I added SQL and pNotify into this script and a detection system, so if you leave the server while in jail it will put you back in jail. Also added a 4th jail that will send you back if you leave. Also I added a fine system. Using /jail4 will send you to big prison. Jager Bom [dev Oasis Island] made the orginal i just added more things to make it work with the database and made it a lot better in general From hi script I used this: The /jail command and the only cops can jail. Everything else I did.

How to use script:
/jail1 id time reason 


the reason must be without spaces. For example: GTA|Fleeing| you cannot do this: GTA Fleeing. 

/fine id amount 

I fixed the script so it is only esx. It was orginally working with esx and my core. Now it should work.  The pnotify will need to be edited by you. ATM when it alerts people it will not say the name of who was jailed, but that can be done easily if you're competent.
