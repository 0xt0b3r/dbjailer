ANYONE seen using my script without my permission will habe legal action taken afainst them. BY DOWNLOADING THIS SCRIPT YOU AGREE TO FOLLOW THE LISENSE.

DB Jailer Created by SSPUW. Saves Jail Time in the DB and players spawn back into the city and serve out the rest of there sentence, now players can't just relog and leave jail.
