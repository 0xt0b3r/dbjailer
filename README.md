# dbjailer
#  Released with help from Jager Bom. 
# I coded the SQL, pNotify, fine system, jail4(not in atm), and cleaned up the code. Jager helped me with changing the PED Coords, and doing the line of code that ensures only cops can use the command. 

How to use script:
/jail1 id time reason 
/jail2 id time reason 
/jail3 id time reason 


the reason must be without spaces. For example: GTA|Fleeing| you cannot do this: GTA Fleeing. 

/fine id amount 

I fixed the script so it is only esx. It was orginally working with esx and my core. Now it should work.  The pnotify will need to be edited by you. ATM when it alerts people it will not say the name of who was jailed, but that can be done easily if you're competent.
