# dbjailer
# Modified script. I added SQL and pNotify into this script and a detection system, so if you leave the server while in jail it will put you back in jail. Also added a 4th jail that will send you back if you leave. Also I added a fine system. Using /jail4 Jager Bom [dev Oasis Island] made the orginal.

How to use script:
/jail1 id time reason 


the reason must be without spaces. For example: GTA|Fleeing| you cannot do this: GTA Fleeing. 

/fine id amount
